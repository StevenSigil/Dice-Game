# Dice-Game
### A web app with minimal but fun styling that served as my introduction to JavaScript!

This is a basic dice rolling app. Click the roll again button and it will return either Player1/Player2 Won or it was a tie.

The app uses the standard Math.random function to determine the outcome, and the querySelector to change the text/images. Looking back, it's extremely simple yet was the foundation for many other projects.
