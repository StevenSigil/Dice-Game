# Dice-Game
A basic web app with minimal styling that served as my introduction to JavaScript

This is a basic dice rolling app. Click the *roll again* button and it will return either Player1/Player2 Won or it was a tie.  

The app uses the standard Math.random function to determine the outcome, and the querySelector to change the text/images.  Looking back, it's extremely simple yet was the foundation for many other projects.
